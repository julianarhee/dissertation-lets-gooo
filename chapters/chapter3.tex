\newthought{Rats rely on vision} for many behaviors, such as hunting, jumping and depth perception, spatial navigation, and shape discrimination. Over the past few years, a subset of contiguous areas spanning the lateral edge of rat cortex have garnered significant attention due to possible similarities with the primate ventral visual stream. Several studies \cite{Vermaercke2014, Tafazoli2017, Vinken2016} have investigated these visual areas --- V1, LM, LI, and LL --- specifically in the context of visual object representations in order to test the extent to which single neuron characteristics of primate IT, the highest level of the primate ventral stream, might also be found in the lateral most areas in the rat. 

% Name some known examples for how mice and primates are different.
However, monkeys and rodents, differ in dramatic ways --- on one hand, similarities in how their visual systems solve a given problem are incredibly exciting, as they point to general principles conserved across species. On the other hand, each solution is likely to be influenced by differences in the natural visual statistics by which their visual systems have been shaped. For example, in primates and cats, cells with similar orientation preferences are organized in columnar structures in V1. In contrast, as shown by one of the first two-photon imaging studies of rat V1, and many mouse studies thereafter, rodents have a salt-and-pepper-like organization of orientation preference that does not appear to have an obvious global structure\cite{Ohki2005}). 

Over the past decade, mice have become increasingly popular for studying visual circuits. This is arguably due to the immensely powerful genetic tools combined with chronic, large-scale population recordings, much of which are prohibitively challenging to use in monkeys. In contrast, although rats have long been studied for visually-guided behaviors, large-scale cellular resolution access to their visual cortex has proved to be far more challenging. Using the methods and approaches described in the previous chapter, the first goal was to provide a systematic study of rat visual cortex, thus providing valuable points of comparison to mice and primates.

% Broad overview of experiment design -- all the stimuli.
Several studies have characterized single-unit response properties of lateral extrastriate areas in rats that may be similar to those found in the primate ventral stream\cite{Tafazoli2017, Vermaercke2014, Vermaercke2015}, namely, areas V1, LM, LI, LL, and TE. However, these studies specifically characterized single-unit responses to object stimuli --- much less is known about more basic response properties of these visual areas. I sought to provide a comprehensive survey of basic, visual response properties across different cortical areas in the rat using optical imaging. Given their possible role in visual object recognition behaviors, areas V1, LM, and LI are an exciting starting point for combining the powerful tools common in traditional genetic models like mice with the kinds of complex behaviors associated with primates.

Using a large battery of visual stimuli (Figure\ref{fig:experiment_design}), I characterized basic visual response properties of these three areas for the first time with cellular resolution imaging. In the same sessions, I also tested a subset of the complex visual object stimuli used to test the perceptual behavior of trained rats (described in Chapter 1), which will be discussed in Chapter 4. 

\section{Identification of two-photon imaging sites}
To select regions of the cranial window to focus on for two-photon imaging, I used the wide-field maps of the full window to identify macro-level areal borders based on the mirror reflections of the retinotopic gradients. The distinct blood vessel patterns provided common fiducuiary markings between the larger, macro-scale view, and the smaller, two-photon views. The two imaging views were registered to each other offline to validate the coarse-grained targeting done by eye. For the coregistration, I acquired an anatomical volume at the start of each session. This was a surface-level volume that captured the fiduciary markers in both red and green channels (see Methods). Acquiring the multi-channel anatomical volume also helped for identifying and returning to the same FOV across days. 

Every two-photon field-of-view (FOV) was first evaluated with localizer sessions that I conducted on no more than a few days (usually within 1 day) prior to full functional sessions. Localizers identified which parts of the visual field corresponded to a given imaging site: both a broadscale retinotopic map of the twp-photon FOV and receptive field (RF) estimates of individual cells were used to a) validate which visual area(s) a given FOV contained, and b) identify the portion of the visual field that would stimulate most of the cells in the FOV. I used two types of mapping protocols for targeting different scales of retinotopic organization. The first (``Moving Bar Retinotopy'') captured broad retinotopic preferences across the FOV using the same cycling bar stimulus used to identify area borders in wide-field maps (see Chapter 2, \ref{fig:retino_mapping}). The second (``Receptive Field Mapping'') provided a more fine-scaled characterization of individual receptive fields for each neuron in the selected FOV:  I used a time-consuming, albeit highly reliable, approach in which small portions of the visual field were systematically stimulated in a tiled manner to estimate the receptive field positions and extents of all cells. Besides characterizing basic receptive field properrties of single cells, this experiment was also important for accurately identifying the region of visual space to target, as only a subset of the experiments used full-field stimuli (see Figure\ref{supfig:vf_targeting}).

I also created a semi-automated analysis pipeline (see Methods) for fast data analysis of imaging sets acquired the same day. This allowed me to identify and validate multiple two-photon imaging sites on the same day. Only FOVs that had identifable visual field representations were included for full functional runs. For full functional runs, I presented a large battery of visual stimuli, including the same stimuli used for localizer runs, in interleaved blocks (Figure\ref{fig:experiment_design}). I selected both simple, classically used stimuli and more complex object stimuli, which together provide common grounds for a range of visual response peroprties described in lateral extrastriate cortex of rodents. The final stimulus sets included drifting gratings of multiple orientations, spatial frequencies, and speeds, and a subset of the complex object stimuli used to test rats' perceptual behavior (as described in Chapter 1).

\section{Retinotopic organization of lateral extrastriate cortex}
While previous studies have relied on coarse retinotopy to identify the areas in which they were recording, the fine-scale retinotopic organization of cell bodies in any extrastriate area of rats remains unknown. Using the same phase-encoding Fourier paradigm I used to measure retinotopic gradients in wide-field maps, I characterized retinotopic preferences across a given two-photon field-of-view (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}A). Two-photon FOVs were registered to wide-field vasculature maps offline by aligning blood vessels present in both images (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}B-C, and see Methods).

\end{figure}

Sweeps of the cycling bar produced robust responses in individual cells throughout the FOV (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}D). I observed smooth retinotopic gradients across visual axes of elevation (ventral-dorsal) and azimuth (nasal-temporal) for all included FOVs (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E). Overall, the gradients matched the sign and direction of the corresponding regions in wide-field maps (for example, green to blue for the V1 FOV shown in (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E)), and on average, the particular retinotopic preferences of most individual cell bodies were similar to that of their background neuropil.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------
% Cortical magnification
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cortical magnification is anisotropic}
The particular region and extent of visual space that a patch of cortex represents has important implications for its function. For example, in primates, most areas of the ventral stream over-represent the central visual field, enhancing the processing of features near the fovea\cite{Gattass2005CorticalDynamics}. Although mice and rats do not have foveal vision, several groups have shown biases of visual field representations in different areas of mouse visual cortex\cite{Garrett2014, Marshel2011, Sit2020}. To quantify how much surface area is devoted to a given unit of visual space in rat extrastriate cortex, I measured cortical magnification for each FOV recorded in areas V1, LM and LI. For each FOV, I calculated the spatial axis of maximal retinotopic change --- this axis was not always aligned to the axes of the imaging plane (for example, the elevation gradient in  Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E is at an oblique angle. I then fit a linear model to determine the relationship between the change in visual field representation along a given axis (azimuth or elevation) and the change across cortical space (see Methods). Overall, I found that cortical magnification decreased from V1 to LM to LI. This is consistent with the fact that larger areas like V1 take up more surface area, and thus have more cortical real estate dedicated per unit of visual field (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}F). 

Cortical magnification is not necessarily isotropic, \textit{i.e.}, equal along vertical (azimuth) and horizontal (elevation) axes of the visual field. I found an asymmetric expansion along the vertical dimension of visual space in rat V1, as well as in areas LM and LI (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}G). This asymmetry is consistent with findings in mouse V1, where several studies have observed an expanded representation along elevation\cite{Garrett2014, Liang2018, Bonin2011}.

\subsection{Retinotopy is locally scattered}
Despite the overall continuity in retinotopic gradients across the FOVs, there were also slight deviations when comparing the smoothed gradient maps to estimated retinotopic preferences of individual cell bodies (see Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E). Previous studies in mouse visual areas indicate the presence of fine-scale, retinotopic disorganization or scatter across the visual system, from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) inputs, through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), and into V1 and LM\cite{Bonin2011, Andermann2011, Liang2018, Marques2018}. However, it remains unknown whether this scatter propogates further into extrastriate areas of rodent cortex, and whether this is functionally advantageous in any way or a byproduct of biological noise. In order to more finely characterize retinotopic preferences of individual cells, I quantified receptive field (RF) properties by stimulating tiled locations across the visual field (Figure\ref{fig:rf_examples}). 

% fig:rf_examples

\end{figure}

My approach was to measure receptive fields with high resolution for as many cells as possible within the FOV. Previous studies have found improved results by using different stimulation parameters for V1 versus extrastriate areas to map receptive fields in mice\cite{DeVries2020, Allen2016}. Based on previous reports in both mice and rats\cite{Girman1999a, Niell2008,Vermaercke2014,Tafazoli2017,DeVries2020}, I used tile sizes of \ang{5} or \ang{10} of visual angle. Cells with larger receptive fields may not be effectively stimulated by small stimuli, and vice versa, that cells with small receptive fields or sensitivity to surround suppression may be under-stimulated by large stimuli. 

As expected, I found that the larger, \ang{10} tile size resulted in well-fit receptive fields for LI cells. The \ang{5} tile size worked well for both areas V1 and LM. To confirm that the stimulus size did not dramatically affect receptive field parameter estimates, I compared RF metrics for cells with RFs that were well-fit for both the small and larger tile sizes (Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10}). Overall, I found that tile size did not have an obvious effect for RF center estimates. This was important for the goal of obtaining precise retinotopic position estimates for each cell, defined as the center of the fit receptive field. Comparing the other parameters did not reveal obvious differences, though for area V1, which had the largest sample size, there appeared to be a moderate effect on estimates of RF size (Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10}, Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10_aggregate}). Statistical tests on paired measures for \ang{5} and \ang{10} revealed a significant effect of tile size for V1 cells across all RF parameters (p<0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). This was not the case for LM and LI cells, with the exception of estimated x-positions for LI cells, where I observed a weak statistical difference between \ang{5} and \ang{10}. Nonetheless, sample sizes were much smaller for LM and LI, as there were fewer cells that were well-fit with both the small and large tile stimulation protocols. Given the lack of obvious systematic biases in the receptive field parameters based on stimulus size (except for V1), and the tight correlation in RF position estimates, the initial assumptions about which stimulus to use for each visual area seemed sufficiently validated. I thus selected the smaller, \ang{5} tile size for V1 and LM, and the larger, \ang{10} tile size for LI. All analyses in which parameter estimates were directly compared between areas were repeated and independently compared for RFs measured with \ang{5} or \ang{10} (see Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10_aggregate}), which confirmed that there were no qualititative differences.

% \subsection{Retinotopic scatter is asymmetric}
% Average cortical scatter
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
To quantify retinotopic scatter, I compared measured receptive field positions to the coarse-grained retinotopic gradient across each imaging field. Specifically, for a given population of cells recorded in a FOV, I calculated the global retinotopic gradient using smoothed estimates of neuropil preferences across the FOV (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}A). Since the vertical and horizontal axes of the visual field representation is not necessarily aligned to anterior-posterior or medial-lateral axes of the cortical surface, I computed a simple transformation that identified the directions of maximal change along each direction based on the smoothed neuropil retinotopic map. Briefly, to compute the spatial axis corresponding to the global retinotopic gradient for each axis, I used the average gradient vector across the FOV. The smoothed retinotopic map was then projected along this mean gradient vector, and the predicted location of each pixel was defined as its projected location along this new spatial axis (see Methods).

    \label{fig:retino_scatter}}
\end{figure}

Most cell bodies exhibited a coarse-scale retinotopic organization (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}B). However, at the level of neighboring cells, retinotopic preferences were disordered and deviated from the expected preferences based on relative cortical location. To ensure the observed scatter was not simply measurement noise, I performed a bootstrap analyses to estimate 95\% confidence intervals for all measured receptive field positions along each axis. Specifically, for each cell, I determined whether the 95\% confidence interval estimated for its receptive field position (along azimuth and elevation) overlapped with the 95\% confidence interval estimated for the linear fit defining its predicted receptive field location (along azimuth and elevation) based on its cortical position. Cells with reliable fits that nonethless had non-overlapping 95\% CIs were determined to be true deviants. 

% Overall scatter & asymmetric scatter in X, Y
I next wondered whether the scatter in receptive field position was systematically related to scatter in cortical space. To quantify the scale of scatter, that is, the extent to which scatter in a cell's receptive field position corresponds to or is offset by scatter in its cortical position, I measured deviations along cortical distance versus visual field position for each cell (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}C). Overall, average scatter in cortical space decreased from V1 to LM to LI (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}D, V1: $\sim$239.09$um$, Lm: $\sim$163.48$um$, Li: $\sim$127.17$um$), corresponding to average retinotopic displacements that increased from V1 to LM to LI (V1: $\sim$2.9; LM: $\sim$5.3; LI: $\sim$6.5 degrees of visual angle). This relative pattern is consistent with the relatively smaller cortical size of areas LM and LI relative to V1 (that is, larger area, more room for error).  

Notably, the observed retinotopic scatter was asymmetric between vertical and horizontal dimensions:  deviations from predicted cortical locations were ~2 fold larger along elevation than azimuth. In V1, this asymmetric scatter in cortical position was roughly proportional to cortical magnification --- that is, for a given unit of visual field space, I observed $\sim$2-fold expansion in cortical space  for elevation, relative to azimuth, along with a proportional amount of scatter in receptive field positions. In LM and LI, however, I observed less scatter in predicted receptive field positions along the elevation axis than would be expected from the measured cortical scatter if scatter was proportional to the cortical magnification of elevation over azimuth.

\subsection{Receptive fields are anisotropic}
Given the observed asymmetry in cortical magnification along azimuth and elevation (see Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}), I asked whether this asymmetry was also present at the level of individual receptive field shapes. I first quantified overall receptive field size as the average widths along the horizontal and vertical axes (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}A). As expected, average receptive field sizes increased from V1 to LM to LI (V1: $\sim$\ang{8.81}, Lm: $\sim$\ang{10.45}, LI: $\sim$\ang{13.54} of visual angle, p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test, adjusted for multiple comparisons with Benjamini/Hochberg). This was generally true regardless of whether comparisons were restricted only to cells fit using either the small or large stimulus size for all visual areas (Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10_aggregate}. Gradual increases in average receptive field size along areas V1, LM, and LI has been observed with electrophysiological recordings of single-units\cite{Vermaercke2014, Tafazoli2017}, and is also a hallmark of hierarchically-organized visual areas, based on the primate ventral stream, is a gradual increase in average receptive field size\cite{Rust2010SelectivityIT, Vermaercke2014, Siegle2021, Tafazoli2017}.

% Interestingly, the amount of scatter in the predicted receptive field locations corresponded to roughly half or less than the average receptive field size of each visual area (REFREF, V1: $\sim$\ang{8.81}, Lm: $\sim$\ang{10.45}, LI: $\sim$\ang{13.54} of visual angle). However, at the level of individual cells, there was no obvious relationship between receptive field size and degree of scatter (Pearson’s correlation, p>0.05 for all visual areas).

Also shown is the projection of the major axis of each ellipse onto the horizontal (middle) or vertical (right) axes of visual space for each cell. Each dot represents one cell.

    \textbf{B.} Anisotropy, measured as the ratio of major to minor axes of the fit ellipse, as a function of receptive field angle. Each dot is a cell.

Receptive field angles of 0 represent orientations parallel to the horizontal axis, and 90 degrees represents orientation parallel to the vertical axis.
    \textbf{C.} Receptive field overlap as a function of cortical distance. For each pair of cells, overlap is measured as the intersection of their receptive fields divided by their union. Error bars, SD.  
    \label{fig:rf_aggregate}}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, when comparing the extent of vertical or horizontal space covered by each receptive field, I found that although similar relationships between visual areas remained consistent (V1 and LM smaller than LI), the horizontal dimensions were consistently larger than the vertical dimensions for all visual areas, suggesting that most receptive fields were anisotropic (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}A). For each cell, I calculated the degree of anisotropy by taking the ratio of the major and minor axes of the fit ellipses. Most receptive fields exhibited some degree of anisotropy, and most cells had receptive field that were oriented toward 0 degrees, \textit{i.e.}, elongated along azimuth (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}B). 

To determine the extent to which these broad-level shape characteristics of the receptive fields might be related to the spatial organization of the cells, I estimated the degree of receptive field similarity at varying distances across cortical space. Specifically, for each pair of receptive fields in a given FOV, I calculated the ratio of the intersection of their receptive fields to their union. Pairs of cells with highly similar receptive fields in terms of overall shape, extent, and position, will have high overlap fractions, while dissimilar receptive fields will have low overlap fractions. Overall, I found that receptive field similarities (measured as overlap) decreased with increasing cortical distance (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}C). Cells in V1 exhibited a more gradual drop-off, which may be expected given the larger visual field space covered by a given imaging FOV. 


% However, we did not observe strong relationships between anisotropy and retinotopic scatter (REFREF, Supplemental 3.3) nor between angular bias in anisotropy (horizontally or vertically anisotropic, see Methods) and retinotopic position (REFREF, Supplemental 3.4). 
% -Sit & Goard, bias for cells representing LOWER visual field, stronger coherent motion response -- spatial asymmetry in motion representation/sensitivity

% Spherical correction check:
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible that the observed receptive field anisotropy is a byproduct of the fact that the monitor was placed close to the animal's eye, thus distorting the appearance of stimuli presented at extreme edges of the monitor. Typically, in rodent vision studies, the monitor can be placed quite close the animal's eyes, thus covering a much larger extent of the animal's visual field, due to the fact that rodents have a large depth of field\cite{Blakema1982}. In standard visual field mapping studies, the screen is close enough to the animal's eye that significant warping can occur at the edges of the visual field, relative to the portions directly in front of the animal, which produces a type of ``fishbowl'' effect. Since most cells had receptive fields located toward the center of the monitor, which was specifically targeted by design (with the localizer sessions), it was unlikely that distortion at the edge of the screen would have a significant impact on the overall findings --- this was also why the stimuli were not presented with a spherically corrected warp (see Methods). However, since some cells had large receptive fields that extended to and beyond the limits of the monitor, it was important to quantify this more precisely. 

Experimenters often correct for the monitor distortion by presenting an inversely distorted stimulus, effectively reversing the warped appearance by presenting an already warped stimulus\cite{Labrigger2012}. Alternatively, the stimuli can be presented as is, on the flat monitor, and the measured responses can be transformed according to the predicted perceived distortion. I calculated a posthoc spherial correction with the latter approach:  I applied the reverse transform typically used to warp stimuli for spherical correction, and then calculated the same metrics for all warped receptive field maps (Figure\ref{supfig:spherical_correction_steps}). As expected, the correction had a much less apparent effect for smaller receptive fields near the center of the monitor, compared to the larger receptive fields near the edges (see Figure\ref{supfig:spherical_correction_examples}). Overall, the qualitative trends observed in receptive field metrics remained similar even with the spherical correction: receptive field sizes increased from V1 to LM to LI, receptive fields were anisotropic in all three areas, and this anisotropy was largely biased toward elongations along the horizontal axis (Figure\ref{supfig:spherical_correction_aggregate}).

% Maybe this is for better visual field coverage?
These receptive field asymmetries are consistent with the observed expansion in the cortical representation of visual space along the vertical axis in that the relative compression of the vertical axis in receptive field shape might enable higher-resolution representations along the vertical dimension than if receptive fields were perfectly isotropic. To test the idea that these asymmetries might might afford more precise or improved visual field coverage, I next asked how the visual field representations compared with and without the observed asymmetries and biases.

Specifically, I wondered whether the observed irregularities might allow enhanced visual field coverage. For all simultaneously recorded cells in a given imaging site, I compared how the distribution of receptive fields across the visual field changed if all irregularities were removed. To nullify retinotopic scatter, I assigned the predicted receptive field position to each cell, and to nullify receptive field anisotropy, I assigned size along each axis to be equal to the average of the two axes such that simulated receptive field shapes were perfectly isotropic (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}A). I then calculated the variance of the distributions of receptive field counts across the visual field as a measure of how uniformly the receptive fields covered the visual field:  higher variance indicates receptive fields are clustered in select locations, while lower variance indicates receptive fields are more evenly spread out (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}B). Overall, simulated receptive field distributions resulted in a less uniform visual field coverage than measured distributions (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}D), paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V1, p=0.01; LM, p=0.05; LI, p=0.07). The fold-change in variance was greater than 1 (no difference) for all imaging sites, though we did not observe significant differences between visual areas (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}E).

\section{Orientation and direction tuning}
Given the observed retinotopic disorder at small micron scales, I asked whether neurons might be organized by tuning to other visual features. In highly visual animals, like primates and cats, orientation tuning exhibits a spatial organization in which columns of cortex show repeating ``pinwheel'' structures of preferred orientations. In contrast, studies of rodent visual cortex have shown a disorganized, ``salt-and-pepper'' organization\cite{Ohki2005}, even in more visual rodents like the squirrel\cite{VanHooser2005}. The lack of clear global structure in one but the presence of clear orientation selectivity in both rodents and primates suggests that they represent alternative paths to achieving the same functionality.

% REFREF add why chose the selected parameter levels?
I measured calcium responses to drifting gratings over a range of drift directions, spatial frequencies, speeds, and sizes (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}A-C). Specifically, I tested 8 different directions, and for each, tested two levels for each of the non-direction parameters. For each cell, I estimated direction tuning curves using bootstrapped estimations with multiple criteria for evaluating the stability and goodness-of-fit (see Methods)\cite{Liang2018}. These steps ensured that all included cells had highly robust fits. 

Overall, the fraction of cells tuned to the drifting gratings stimuli was similar across visual areas (defined as visually responsive cells for which a tuning curve could be fit), as well the fraction of cells that were robustly and reliably well-fit (goodness-of-fit criteria, see Methods) (Figure\ref{supfig:gratings_aggregate}). Consistent with previous studies in rats and other rodents, I found a salt-and-pepper-like organization in V1 FOVs, as well as LM and LI FOVs (see Figure\ref{fig:gratings}B for an example FOV). I also observed an overall bias in the relative direction preferences across cells. Specifically, motion along the cardinal axes was over-represented in areas V1 and LM, though less so in LI (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}D). In particular, a large fraction of V1 cells preferred horizontally-oriented, vertically-moving gratings.  

% asi/dsi
To determine the extent to which these biases were specific to axes of motion or particular directions of motion, I calculated an index of axis- and direction-selectivity for each cell. Visually responsive cells were classified as responsive to a given direction of motion (direction-selective, DS), or to opposing directions of motion along a given axis (axis-selective, AS), or neither direction- or axis-selective. Overall, I found that the fraction of cells that were axis-selective was signficantly smaller in LI, relative to V1 and LM, whie the fraction of direction-selective cells was comparable across areas (Figure\ref{supfig:gratings_aggregate}A). However, the extent or degree of selectivity signficantly differed between the three areas: while axis selectivity significantly decreased from V1 to LM to LI, direction selectivity was significantly greater in LI, than in LM and V1 (Mann-Whitney U-test, p<0.01, corrected for mulitple comparisons with Benjamini/Hochberg method, see Figure\ref{supfig:gratings_aggregate}B-C).

Finally, I compared spatial frequency, size, and speed preferences for all cells responsive to the gratings stimuli (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}F). Since only two levels were tested for each of these non-direction metrics, one high and one low, I calculated a simple preference index for each and report which of the two (\textit{e.g.}, low versus high spatial frequency) each cell preferred based on bootstrappped estimates see Methods). I did not observe any dramatic differences in preferences for the slower or faster speeds (10 versus 20 degrees per second). Overall, most cells in all three visual areas exhibited a slight preference for the apertured stimuli. On average, the fraction of cells that exhibited a size preference was greater for V1 FOVs, relative to LM and LI (see Figure\ref{supfig:gratings_aggregate}D). For spatial frequency preferences, there was an overall weak preference for the lower(0.1 cycles/degree) spatial frequency compared to the higher (0.5 cycles/degree). On average, the fraction of cells exhibiting a preference for spatial frequency was greater for V1 FOVs (Figure\ref{supfig:gratings_aggregate}D). However, only two spatial frequencies were tested, and more extensive testing of spatial frequency and temporal frequency ranges would determine the extent to which each visual area exhibits clear functional preferences as has been observed between different extrastriate areas of mouse\cite{Niell2008, Andermann2011, Marshel2011}. 


% Orientating tuning similarity v distance?
To compare overall tuning preferences across the range of tested gratings conditions, I created an averaged tuning profile for each cell, defined as the trial-averaged response to each condition, and measured similarity as the correlation coefficient between tuning profiles (Methods). If visual areas exhibit a purely salt-and-pepper organization, tuning similarity and cortical distance should be independent. To determine the extent to which cells might be organized according to their tuning to drifting gratings, I compared the tuning profiles between cells to their cortical distance, defined as the distance between each cell’s center of mass in the image plane. On average, I found no observable relationship between cortical distance and tuning similarity for areas V1 and LM, though there was a slight reduction at the largest distances for LI cell pairs (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}G). 

% Signal correlations vs. percent-overlap?.
Given the observed anisotropies in receptive field shape, I wondered whether a cell's direction or axis preference was related to the orientation or angle of its receptive field. That is, a cell highly tuned to vertical (upward or downward) motion might have a receptive field elongated along the vertical dimension, parallel to the preferred direction of motion. On the other hand, the receptive field might be elongated along the axis perpendicular to direction of motion (horizontally elongated), reflecting the cell's preferred tuning to horizontal edges. To determine the extent to which similarity in tuning might be explained by receptive field properties, I looked at signal correlations as a function of receptive field overlap. The resulst were largely limited by the low numbers of cells in which both robust receptive field fits and strong direction tuning fits were found. Most cells had receptive fields oriented along the azimuthal axis (as described above). Of these cells, I found that their preferred axis of motion was approximately orthogonal to their receptive field orientations:  cells with horizontally-oriented receptive fields appeared to prefer  vertically-moving gratings (Figure\ref{supfig:theta_vs_rf}).

\section{Concluding remarks}
The present study provides a first systematic characterization of rat visual cortex using cellular resolution imaging. Previous studies of extrastriate visual areas in the rat have been done with electrophysiology in anesthetized animals\cite{Girman1999a, Vermaerke2014, Tafazoli2017} (though see \citet{Scott2018} for V1 responses in transgenic rats to a limited set of gratings stimuli).


Given the somewhat inconsistent coverage of viral GCaMP expression across multiple injection sites, area LL was not easy to identify with confidence (see the Discussion below).

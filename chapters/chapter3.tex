\newthought{Rats rely on vision} for many behaviors, such as hunting, jumping and depth perception, spatial navigation, and shape discrimination. Over the past few years, a subset of contiguous areas spanning the lateral edge of rat cortex have garnered significant attention due to possible similarities with the primate ventral visual stream. Several studies \cite{Vermaercke2014, Tafazoli2017, Vinken2016} have investigated these visual areas --- V1, LM, LI, and LL --- specifically in the context of visual object representations in order to test the extent to which single neuron characteristics of primate IT, the highest level of the primate ventral stream, might also be found in the lateral most areas in the rat. 

% Name some known examples for how mice and primates are different.
However, monkeys and rodents, differ in dramatic ways --- on one hand, similarities in how their visual systems solve a given problem are incredibly exciting, as they point to general principles conserved across species. On the other hand, each solution is likely to be influenced by differences in the natural visual statistics by which their visual systems have been shaped. For example, in primates and cats, cells with similar orientation preferences are organized in columnar structures in V1. In contrast, as shown by one of the first two-photon imaging studies of rat V1, and many mouse studies thereafter, rodents have a salt-and-pepper-like organization of orientation preference that does not appear to have an obvious global structure\cite{Ohki2005}). 

Over the past decade, mice have become increasingly popular for studying visual circuits. This is arguably due to the immensely powerful genetic tools combined with chronic, large-scale population recordings, much of which are prohibitively challenging to use in monkeys. In contrast, although rats have long been studied for visually-guided behaviors, large-scale cellular resolution access to their visual cortex has proved to be far more challenging. Using the methods and approaches described in the previous chapter, the first goal was to provide a systematic study of rat visual cortex, thus providing valuable points of comparison to mice and primates.

% Broad overview of experiment design -- all the stimuli.
Several studies have characterized single-unit response properties of lateral extrastriate areas in rats that may be similar to those found in the primate ventral stream\cite{Tafazoli2017, Vermaercke2014, Vermaercke2015}, namely, areas V1, LM, LI, LL, and TE. However, these studies specifically characterized single-unit responses to object stimuli --- much less is known about more basic response properties of these visual areas. I sought to provide a comprehensive survey of basic, visual response properties across different cortical areas in the rat using optical imaging. Given their possible role in visual object recognition behaviors, areas V1, LM, and LI are an exciting starting point for combining the powerful tools common in traditional genetic models like mice with the kinds of complex behaviors associated with primates.

Using a large battery of visual stimuli (Figure\ref{fig:experiment_design}), I characterized basic visual response properties of these three areas for the first time with cellular resolution imaging. In the same sessions, I also tested a subset of the complex visual object stimuli used to test the perceptual behavior of trained rats (described in Chapter 1), which will be discussed in Chapter 4. 

\section{Identification of two-photon imaging sites}
To select regions of the cranial window to focus on for two-photon imaging, I used the wide-field maps of the full window to identify macro-level areal borders based on the mirror reflections of the retinotopic gradients. The distinct blood vessel patterns provided common fiducuiary markings between the larger, macro-scale view, and the smaller, two-photon views. The two imaging views were registered to each other offline to validate the coarse-grained targeting done by eye. For the coregistration, I acquired an anatomical volume at the start of each session. This was a surface-level volume that captured the fiduciary markers in both red and green channels (see Methods). Acquiring the multi-channel anatomical volume also helped for identifying and returning to the same FOV across days. 

Every two-photon field-of-view (FOV) was first evaluated with localizer sessions that I conducted on no more than a few days (usually within 1 day) prior to full functional sessions. Localizers identified which parts of the visual field corresponded to a given imaging site: both a broadscale retinotopic map of the twp-photon FOV and receptive field estimates of individual cells were used to a) validate which visual area(s) a given FOV contained, and b) identify the portion of the visual field that would stimulate most of the cells in the FOV. I used two types of mapping protocols for targeting different scales of retinotopic organization. The first (``Moving Bar Retinotopy'') captured broad retinotopic preferences across the FOV using the same cycling bar stimulus used to identify area borders in wide-field maps (see Chapter 2, \ref{fig:retino_mapping}). The second (``Receptive Field Mapping'') provided a more fine-scaled characterization of individual receptive fields for each neuron in the selected FOV:  I used a time-consuming, albeit highly reliable, approach in which small portions of the visual field were systematically stimulated in a tiled manner to estimate the receptive field positions and extents of all cells. Besides characterizing basic receptive field properrties of single cells, this experiment was also important for accurately identifying the region of visual space to target, as only a subset of the experiments used full-field stimuli. 

I also created a semi-automated analysis pipeline (see Methods) for fast data analysis of imaging sets acquired the same day. This allowed me to identify and validate multiple two-photon imaging sites on the same day. Only FOVs that had identifable visual field representations were included for full functional runs. For full functional runs, I presented a large battery of visual stimuli, including the same stimuli used for localizer runs, in interleaved blocks (Figure\ref{fig:experiment_design}). I selected both simple, classically used stimuli and more complex object stimuli, which together provide common grounds for a range of visual response peroprties described in lateral extrastriate cortex of rodents. The final stimulus sets included drifting gratings of multiple orientations, spatial frequencies, and speeds, and a subset of the complex object stimuli used to test rats' perceptual behavior (as described in Chapter 1).

\section{Fine-scale retinotopic organization in rat lateral cortex}
While previous studies have relied on coarse retinotopy to identify the areas in which they were recording, the fine-scale retinotopic organization of cell bodies in any extrastriate area of rats remains unknown. Using the same phase-encoding Fourier paradigm I used to measure retinotopic gradients in wide-field maps, I characterized retinotopic preferences across a given two-photon field-of-view (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}A). Two-photon FOVs were registered to wide-field vasculature maps offline by aligning blood vessels present in both images (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}B-C, and see Methods).

\end{figure}

Sweeps of the cycling bar produced robust responses in individual cells throughout the FOV (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}D). I observed smooth retinotopic gradients across visual axes of elevation (ventral-dorsal) and azimuth (nasal-temporal) for all included FOVs (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E). Overall, the gradients matched the sign and direction of the corresponding regions in wide-field maps (for example, green to blue for the V1 FOV shown in (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E)), and on average, the particular retinotopic preferences of most individual cell bodies were similar to that of their background neuropil.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------
% Cortical magnification
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cortical magnification is anisotropic}
The particular region and extent of visual space that a patch of cortex represents has important implications for its function. For example, in primates, most areas of the ventral stream over-represent the central visual field, enhancing the processing of features near the fovea\cite{Gattass2005CorticalDynamics}. Although mice and rats do not have foveal vision, several groups have shown biases of visual field representations in different areas of mouse visual cortex\cite{Garrett2014, Marshel2011, Sit2020}. To quantify how much surface area is devoted to a given unit of visual space in rat extrastriate cortex, I measured cortical magnification for each FOV recorded in areas V1, LM and LI. For each FOV, I calculated the spatial axis of maximal retinotopic change --- this axis was not always aligned to the axes of the imaging plane (for example, the elevation gradient in  Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E is at an oblique angle. I then fit a linear model to determine the relationship between the change in visual field representation along a given axis (azimuth or elevation) and the change across cortical space (see Methods). Overall, I found that cortical magnification decreased from V1 to LM to LI. This is consistent with the fact that larger areas like V1 take up more surface area, and thus have more cortical real estate dedicated per unit of visual field (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}F). 

Cortical magnification is not necessarily isotropic, \textit{i.e.}, equal along vertical (azimuth) and horizontal (elevation) axes of the visual field. I found an asymmetric expansion along the vertical dimension of visual space in rat V1, as well as in areas LM and LI (Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}G). This asymmetry is consistent with findings in mouse V1, where several studies have observed an expanded representation along elevation\cite{Garrett2014, Liang2018, Bonin2011}.

\subsection{Retinotopy is locally disorganized}
Despite the overall continuity in retinotopic gradients across the FOVs, there were also slight deviations when comparing the smoothed gradient maps to estimated retinotopic preferences of individual cell bodies (see Figure\ref{fig:2p_retino}E). Previous studies in mouse visual areas indicate the presence of fine-scale, retinotopic disorganization or scatter across the visual system, from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) inputs, through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), and into V1 and LM\cite{Bonin2011, Andermann2011, Liang2018, Marques2018}. However, it remains unknown whether this scatter propogates further into extrastriate areas of rodent cortex, and whether this is functionally advantageous in any way or a byproduct of biological noise. In order to more finely characterize retinotopic preferences of individual cells, I quantified receptive field (RF) properties by stimulating tiled locations across the visual field (Figure\ref{fig:rf_examples}). 

% fig:rf_examples

\end{figure}

My approach was to achieve receptive field measurements with high resolution for as many cells as possible within the FOV. Previous studies have found improved results by using different stimulation parameters for V1 versus extrastriate areas to map receptive fields in mice\cite{DeVries2020, Allen2016}. Based on previous reports in both mice and rats\cite{Girman1999a, Niell2008,Vermaercke2014,Tafazoli2017,DeVries2020}, I used tile sizes of \ang{5} or \ang{10} of visual angle. Cells with larger receptive fields may not be effectively stimulated by small stimuli, and vice versa, that cells with small receptive fields or sensitivity to surround suppression may be under-stimulated by large stimuli. 

As expected, I found that the larger, \ang{10} tile size resulted in well-fit receptive fields for LI cells. The \ang{5} tile size worked well for both areas V1 and LM. To confirm that the stimulus size did not dramatically affect receptive field parameter estimates, I compared RF metrics for cells with RFs that were well-fit for both the small and larger tile sizes (Supplementary Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10}). Overall, I found that tile size did not have an obvious effect for RF center estimates. This was important for the goal of obtaining precise retinotopic position estimates for each cell, defined as the center of the fit receptive field. Comparing the other parameters did not reveal obvious differences, though for area V1, which had the largest sample size, there appeared to be a moderate effect on estimates of RF size. Statistical tests on paired measures for \ang{5} and \ang{10} revealed a significant effect of tile size for V1 cells across all RF parameters (p<0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). This was not the case for LM and LI cells, with the exception of estimated x-positions for LI cells, where I observed a weak statistical difference between \ang{5} and \ang{10}. Nonetheless, sample sizes were much smaller for LM and LI, as there were fewer cells that were well-fit with both the small and large tile stimulation protocols.

Given the lack of obvious systematic biases in the receptive field parameters based on stimulus size, except for V1, and I selected the smaller, \ang{5} tile size for V1 and LM, and the larger, \ang{10} tile size for LI for the remaining analyses. All analyses in which parameter estimates were directly compared between areas were repeated and independently compared for RFs measured with \ang{5} or \ang{10} (see Supplementary Figure\ref{supfig:rf5_rf10}), which confirmed that there were no qualititative differences.

% \subsection{Retinotopic scatter is asymmetric}
% Average cortical scatter
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
To quantify retinotopic scatter, I compared measured receptive field positions to the coarse-grained retinotopic gradient across each imaging field. Specifically, for a given population of cells recorded in a FOV, I calculated the global retinotopic gradient using smoothed estimates of neuropil preferences across the FOV (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}A). Since the vertical and horizontal axes of the visual field representation is not necessarily aligned to anterior-posterior or medial-lateral axes of the cortical surface, I computed a simple transformation that identified the directions of maximal change along each direction based on the smoothed neuropil retinotopic map. Briefly, to compute the spatial axis corresponding to the global retinotopic gradient for each axis, I used the average gradient vector across the FOV. The smoothed retinotopic map was then projected along this mean gradient vector, and the predicted location of each pixel was defined as its projected location along this new spatial axis (see Methods).

    \label{fig:retino_scatter}}
\end{figure}

After making this correction, we found that most cell bodies exhibited a coarse-scale retinotopic organization (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}). However, at the level of neighboring cells, retinotopic preferences were disordered and deviated from the expected preferences based on relative cortical location. To ensure the observed scatter was not simply measurement noise, we identified true deviants by estimated 95\% confidence intervals for all measured receptive field positions. Specifically, for each cell, we determined whether the 95\% confidence interval estimated for its receptive field position along the vertical or horizontal axes overlapped with the 95\% confidence interval estimated for the linear fit defining its predicted receptive field locations based on cortical position.  


% Overall scatter & asymmetric scatter in X, Y
We next wondered whether the scatter in receptive field position was systematically related scatter in cortical space. To quantify the scale of scatter, that is, the extent to which scatter in the receptive field position corresponds to or is offset by scatter in a cell's cortical position, we measured deviations along cortical distance and visual field position for each cell (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}C). Overall, average scatter in cortical space decreased from V1 to LM to LI (Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}D, V1: $\sim$239.09$um$, Lm: $\sim$163.48$um$, Li: $\sim$127.17$um$), corresponding to average retinotopic displacements that increased from V1 to LM to LI (V1: $\sim$2.9; LM: $\sim$5.3; LI: $\sim$6.5 degrees of visual angle). This relative pattern is consistent with the relatively smaller cortical size of areas LM and LI relative to V1 (that is, larger area, more room for error).  

Notably, the observed retinotopic scatter was asymmetric between vertical and horizontal dimensions:  deviations from predicted cortical locations were ~2 fold larger along elevation than azimuth. In V1, this asymmetric scatter in cortical position was roughly proportional to cortical magnification --- that is, for a given unit of visual field space, we observed $\sim$2-fold expansion in cortical space  for elevation, relative to azimuth, and we see a proportional amount of scatter. In LM and LI, however, we observed less scatter in predicted receptive field positions along the elevation axis than would be expected from the measured cortical scatter if scatter was proportional to the cortical magnification of elevation over azimuth.


% ---------------------------------------------------------------
% RF properties
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
% RFs are anisotropic, elongated along azimuth
% -better resolution in elevation? -- horizontally oblong
Given the observed asymmetry in cortical magnification along azimuth and elevation (see Figure\ref{fig:retino_scatter}), we asked whether this asymmetry was also present at the level of individual receptive field shapes. A hallmark of hierarchically-organized visual areas, based on the primate ventral stream, is a gradual increase in average receptive field size\cite{Rust2010SelectivityIT, Vermaercke2014, Siegle2021, Tafazoli2017}. We quantified overall receptive field size as the average widths along the horizontal and vertical axes (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}A). Consistent with previous electrophysiology measures in rats\cite{Vermaercke2014, Tafazoli2017}, we found that average receptive field size increased from V1 to LM to LI (V1: median 8.8, LM: 10.5 degrees, LI: 13.1 degrees of visual angle, p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test, adjusted for multiple comparisons with Benjamini/Hochberg). This was true regardless of whether comparisons were restricted only to cells fit using either the small or large stimulus size for all visual areas.  

% Interestingly, the amount of scatter in the predicted receptive field locations corresponded to roughly half or less than the average receptive field size of each visual area (REFREF, V1: ~$9.49+/-REFREF$, Lm: ~$10.61+/-REFREF$, LI: ~$13.25+/-REFREF$ degrees of visual angle). However, at the level of individual cells, we observed no correlation between receptive field size and retinotopic scatter (Supp Figure REFREF), stats, Pearson’s correlation, V1: REFREF, p=REFREF, Lm: REFREF, p=REFREF, Li: REFREF, p=REFREF).

\end{figure}

Interestingly, when we split receptive field size according to the extent of vertical or horizontal space covered, we found that the horizontal dimension was consistently larger, suggesting that most receptive fields were anisotropic (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}A). For each cell, we calculated the degree of anisotropy by taking the ratio of the major and minor axes of the fit ellipses. Most receptive fields exhibited some degree of anisotropy, with receptive field angles biased toward 0 degrees, elongated along their azimuthal dimension (Figure\ref{fig:rf_aggregate}B). 
% However, we did not observe strong relationships between anisotropy and retinotopic scatter (REFREF, Supplemental 3.3) nor between angular bias in anisotropy (horizontally or vertically anisotropic, see Methods) and retinotopic position (REFREF, Supplemental 3.4). 
% -Sit & Goard, bias for cells representing LOWER visual field, stronger coherent motion response -- spatial asymmetry in motion representation/sensitivity

% Spherical correction check:
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
To confirm that the observed receptive field anisotropy was not simply due to variable screen distance, we calculated the same metrics with a spherical correction. Typically, in visual field mapping studies, the screen is close enough to the animal's eye that significant warping can occur at the edges of the visual field, relative to the portions directly in front of the animal, producing a ``fishbowl'' effect. Experimenters often correct for this distortion by presenting an inversely distorted stimulus, effectively reversing the warped appearance. Alternatively, the stimuli can be presented as is, on the flat monitor, and the measured responses can be transformed according to the predicted perceived distortion. Using this latter transformation, we found little to no qualitative difference in the relative receptive field metrics: receptive field sizes increased from V1 to LM to LI, receptive fields were anisotropic in all three areas, and this anisotropy was largely biased toward elongations along the horizontal axis.

% Maybe this is for better visual field coverage?
These receptive field asymmetries are consistent with the observed expansion in the cortical representation of visual space along the vertical axis in that the relative compression of the vertical axis in receptive field shape might enable higher-resolution representations along the vertical dimension than if receptive fields were perfectly isotropic. To quantify whether or not this property might afford more precise visual field representations, we compared how faithfully the receptive field organization of a population followed what would be predicted by highly-organized, retinotopic structure.

\end{figure}

Specifically, we wondered whether these irregularities might allow, for example, enhanced visual field coverage. For all simultaneously recorded cells in a given imaging site, we compared how the distribution of receptive fields across the visual field changed if all irregularities were corrected. To nullify retinotopic scatter, we assigned the predicted retinotopic position to each cell, and to nullify receptive field irregularities, we assigned size along each axis to be equal to the average of the two axes such that simulated receptive fields were perfectly isotropic (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}A). We calculated the variance of the distributions of receptive field counts across the visual field as a measure of how uniformly the receptive fields covered the visual field:  higher variance indicates receptive fields are clustered in select locations, while lower variance indicates receptive fields are more evenly spread out (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}B). Overall, simulated receptive field distributions resulted in a less uniform visual field coverage than measured distributions (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}D), paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V1, p=0.01; LM, p=0.05; LI, p=0.07). The fold-change in variance was greater than 1 (no difference) for all imaging sites, though we did not observe significant differences between visual areas (Figure\ref{fig:vf_coverage}E).

\section{Orientation and direction tuning}
Given the observed retinotopic disorder at small micron scales, we asked whether neurons might be organized by tuning to other visual features. In highly visual animals, like primates and cats, orientation tuning exhibits a spatial organization in which columns of cortex show repeating ``pinwheel'' structures of preferred orientations. In contrast, studies of rodent visual cortex have shown a disorganized, ``salt-and-pepper'' organization\cite{Ohki2005}, even in more visual rodents like the squirrel\cite{VanHooser2005}. The lack of clear global structure in one but the presence of clear orientation selectivity in both rodents and primates suggests that they represent alternative paths to achieving the same functionality.

To expand on known characteristics in rodent V1 to extrastriate areas in the rat, we measured calcium responses to drifting gratings over a range of directions, spatial frequencies, speeds, and sizes (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}A-C). For each cell, we estimated tuning curves using bootstrapped estimations with multiple criteria for evaluating the stability and goodness-of-fit (see Methods)\cite{Liang2018}. These steps ensured that all cells included had highly robust fits. Consistent with previous studies in rats and other rodents, we found a rough salt-and-pepper organization in V1 FOVs, as well as LM and LI FOVs (see Figure\ref{fig:gratings}B for an example FOV). Overall, we observed a bias in the relative direction preferences across cells. Specifically, we found that cardinal axes were over-represented in areas V1 and LM, though less so in LI (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}D). In particular, a large fraction of V1 cells preferred horizontally-oriented, vertically-moving gratings.  

To determine the extent to which these biases were specific to axes of motion or particular directions of motion, we calculated an index of axis- and direction-selectivity for each cell. Visually responsive cells were classified as responsive to a given direction of motion (direction-selective, DS), or to opposing directions of motion along a given axis (axis-selective, AS), or neither direction- or axis-selective. Overall, we found that the fraction of cells tuned to axis or direction was similar across areas V1, LM and LI, using conservative measures of selectivity and tuning. Though the fraction of direction and axis selective cells was consistent across areas,  we found that the extent of their selectivity signficantly decreased from V1 to LM to LI: while axis selectivity significantly decreased from V1 to LM to LI, we found that direction selectivity was significantly greater in LI than V1 or LM.

Finally, we also compared spatial frequency, size, and speed preferences at each cell's preferred orientation (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}F). Since we only tested two levels for each of these non-orientation metrics, one high and one low, we calculated a simple preference index for each and report which of the two (\textit{e.g.}, low versus high spatial frequency) each cell preferred based on bootstrappped estimates of the tuning fits (see Methods). We did not observe any clear differences between visual areas in their average preference for either the lower or higher spatial frequency tested (0.1 and 0.5 cycles per degree, respectively), nor for the slower or faster speeds (10 versus 20 degrees per second). We did observe a preference for the apertured gratings in V1 cells, consistent with effects of surround suppression.

% Orientating tuning similarity v distance?
To compare overall tuning preferences across the range of tested gratings conditions, we created an averaged tuning profile for each cell, defined as the trial-averaged response to each condition, and measured similarity as the correlation coefficient between tuning profiles (Methods). If visual areas exhibit a purely salt-and-pepper organization, tuning similarity and cortical distance should be independent. To determine the extent to which cells might be organized according to their tuning to drifting gratings, we compared the tuning profiles between cells to their cortical distance, defined as the distance between each cell’s center of mass in the image plane. On average, we found no observable relationship between cortical distance and tuning similarity for areas V1 and LM, though there was a slight reduction at the largest distances for LI cell pairs (Figure\ref{fig:gratings}G). 

% Signal correlations vs. percent-overlap?.
To determine the extent to which similarity in tuning might be explained by receptive field properties, we also looked at signal correlations as a function of receptive field overlap. Given the observed anisotropies in receptive field shape, we wondered whether a cell's direction or axis preference was related to the orientation or angle of its receptive field. That is, a cell highly tuned to vertical (upward or downward) motion might have a receptive field elongated along the vertical dimension, parallel to the preferred direction of motion. On the other hand, the receptive field might be elongated along the axis perpendicular to direction of motion (horizontally elongated), reflecting the cell's preferred tuning to horizontal edges. We were largely limited by the low numbers of cells in which we measured robust receptive field fits and strong direction tuning fits. However, of the few cells for which both metrics could be confidently measured, we found that receptive field orientations roughly matched axis preferences of neurons in V1 for cells with horizontally-oriented receptive fields and vertically-moving gratings.

Given the somewhat inconsistent coverage of viral GCaMP expression across multiple injection sites, area LL was not easy to identify with confidence (see the Discussion below).

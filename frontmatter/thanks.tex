\newthought{I am deeply grateful} to the many people who have made it possible for me be here today. First and foremost, thank you to my parents, who packed up their lives and moved to a foreign country, knowing neither the language nor the customs, so that my sisters and I could have the best possible life. Thank you for gifting us a world in which we believe anything is possible if we work hard and prepare for those moments when a bit of luck comes around. 

To my advisor, Dave, thank you for taking a chance on a weird Philosophy major. It has been a privilege to learn from you. You taught me so many fundamentals — how to solder, how to build things, and how to stay sane with Github and virtual environments). In many ways you showed me how capable I am of creating something from nothing, which is one of the most valuable lessons I will take with me from grad school. 

To the NeuroEngineering crew, Ed Soucy, Joel Greenwood, Brett Graham, Adam Bercu, thank you for helping me build realities from  vague ideas --- from not just one but three+ microscopes, to all the other weird rat-on-X devices I have conjured up over the years. Ed, you taught me almost everything I know about optics, debugging electrical noise, and perhaps most useful of all, how to use an oscilliscope. Thank you for the countless hours in which you patiently explained and re-explained basic lens concepts, and for never making me feel silly even after the 100th time I asked for help with aligning the lasers. 

To my thesis committee, Jeff Lichtman, Mark Andermann, Venki Murthy, each one of you has gone above and beyond for me. Jeff, you have filled so many roles, from ombudsman to sage scientist — thank you for pushing me to be fearless and go for the big dreams as if they are the only ones. Mark, every chance to talk to you is a true privilege, and this work would not have made it far without our many enlightening discussions. Beyond that, you’ve believed in me even when I did not. Thank you for always being real with me and encouraging me to be who I am. Venki, I am so grateful to you for being true ally. You think of the small things that make all the difference in making someone feel welcome and supported. Though there have been difficult times in my PhD, I’ve been fortunate to be able to talk to you anytime, and to come to you for advice through thick and thin. Thank you for everything.

To Fanuel Muindi, Mike Lawrence, Patti, Lindsay Guest, and MCO --- thank you for supporting me and creating the fabric that makes up this department and program. So much of what you do is behind-the-scenes, answering frantic emails and desperate pleas of help. Thank you so much for your patience and enduring support, even when and especially when things became difficult toward the end. To my lab, we made it! Thanks for the fun times, especially Cesar Echavarr\'{i}a, who understands the blood, sweat, and tears that went into much of this work (I will miss the surgery beers). Thank you to my former deskmate, Max Joesch, who helped build the ultimate scope and taught me so much along the way. A special thanks to Risa Kawai, who forced me to learn how to use a dissection scope and introduced me to some amazing women in science. 

A special thanks to Michael Cohen, George Alvarez, Ken Nakayama, and the Vision Sciences Lab, my first lab experience, an experience that set me on the course I am on today. Michael, I am forever grateful to you for teaching me the fundamentals of scientific research and the importance of being a good mentor. From reading papers to encouraging me to develop my own experiment ideas, and eventually, pushing me to (try to) code like George, you gave me the foundation for so much of what I do now.

Thank you to my Cambridge/Boston family:  Dhaka, you are my brother for life, thank you for believing in me, and always expecting better but loving me at my worst (and converting me into a Boston sports fan \#DoYourJob). The OG Gorham crew and grad family (Gonzo, Tom, Zach), when the dirt hit the tub and crops needed to be watered in the wee AM hours, you were there to keep me sane the entire way. Thank you for helping me to not take life too seriously. To the extended Gorham crew/Boda Team/besties of grad school (Peter, Carmela, Felix, Matt S., Rachel, James A., AshyBoo, Denise), thank you for the White Claws, bolognese nights, and pretty much anything involving food and 90s crunked music nights. To the Old Folks, thank you for being cranky and pessimistic with somewhere by BioLabs and getting weird at Shay's. 

To my PMC family, we came together in solidarity and as allies to face a horrifying year that just seems to get worse and a time of reckoning. You each show me the many complexities of a human navigating turbulent worlds, both the smaller one within academia, and the world out there, and continually teach me how to embrace the good and address the bad (or not). Thank you for the strength, hugs, and food pics that have made what might have been the worst year into one of the best of my grad school years. 

To Zach, you are my best friend, most daring partner-in-crime, and most productive collaborator. In one breath, you can make me laugh when things are super nicht gut, and in the next, talk about PCA with me. Thank you for your tireless help with figures, reading, and thinking. You are my number one co-first. No matter how snowy the night, how cold the wind, how horrible the 2AM p-set, or how warm the beer, everything is good so long as I'm with you and we've got a pocket. You are my favorite human being (Myshka obviously being my favorite creature). Thank you for being super awkward over purple corn drink and sticking around.
